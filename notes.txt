For more information on the Git object database, please read the Git Internals chapter of the Pro Git book.

As an example, if you wanted to commit a change to a file in your repository, you would:

Get the current commit object
Retrieve the tree it points to
Retrieve the content of the blob object that tree has for that particular file path
Change the content somehow and post a new blob object with that new content, getting a blob SHA back
Post a new tree object with that file path pointer replaced with your new blob SHA getting a tree SHA back
Create a new commit object with the current commit SHA as the parent and the new tree SHA, getting a commit SHA back
Update the reference of your branch to point to the new commit SHA
It might seem complex, but it's actually pretty simple when you understand the model and it opens up a ton of things you could potentially do with the API.
